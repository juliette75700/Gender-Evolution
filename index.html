        <p> In this study we take a glance at the problem of gender representation in the world of cinema by exploring comprehensive datasets on movies, tropes and characters in movies. 
          Our analytical approach begins by the categorization of movie tropes through gendered lenses. 
          We trace the trends of the most prominent tropes and their trajectory over time. 
          Complementing our trope analysis, we apply survival analysis techniques to examine the career longevity of individuals in the film industry illustrating the gender-based dynamics.  </p>

        <h2 id="introduction" style="text-align: center;">🎬 Welcome to 'Beyond the Screen' 🎬</h2> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Gender Disparity in Cinema's Narrative </h3>
        <p> Cinema has long been a mirror to our society, often reflecting the norms and values we live by. When we think about movies, it's not just the blockbuster hits or avant-garde masterpieces 
          that come to mind, but also the memorable characters and performances that leave a lasting impact.<br>
          This disparity extends beyond the visible - the characters we see and the stories we hear - to the very fabric of the industry. 
          It's found in the roles offered, the narratives showcased, and the longevity of careers that are often impacted by gender. 
          The influence of these disparities is not just a matter of representation; it shapes careers, defines opportunities, and influences the very stories that reach our screens.
          Our journey through this blog will unravel these layers. We will explore how gendered tropes, though fictive and created for the screen, have real-life implications. These tropes are not just artistic choices; they often reflect and reinforce societal biases. From the archetypal damsel in distress to the fearless action hero, these characters do more than entertain; they shape perceptions and expectations. </p>
  
        </p>
        
        <hr/>

        <h2 id="Part1" style="text-align: center;">🎥 The Scale of Imbalance 🎥</h2>
        <p> The existing gender disparity can be observed on the actor population. Based the actors population of various movies from different genres, dates and nationalities, 
          it was observed a uneven proportion of actresses in absolute number.<br>
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <iframe src="assets/plot/gender_distribution_pie_chart.html" width="550px" height="550px" frameborder="0" style="position: relative;">Proportion gender actor population plot</iframe>
        </div>
          <p>
            What's behind this imbalance? To find answers, we're exploring the world of movie tropes. Could it be that the types of characters they're cast as — the heroes, the villains, the sidekicks — play a part in this disparity?
          </p>
          <p>
            Our next scene delves deeper into the script of gender disparity. We review the world of cinema to understand how these tropes might tip the scales of gender equality. Are the stories told on screen a reflection of the scripts written in the industry or are they re-writing the narrative themselves?
          </p>
<!--- 
        <h3>This is just a question of the times, right? </h3>
        <p> The hypothesis was brought that the gender disparity could have evolved over the time with 
          the evolution of women's rights and their role in the society. <br>
          To be sure we have observed the evolution of the actor population by gender over the years and 
          even if the overall population of actors has increased, the actresses stayed a minority. Even more, it was observed that 
          their rate of population increase was actually less important than the one of the actors.
        <br>

        <h3>The influence of the movies characteristics on gender disparities</h3>
        <p> To understand the reason of this disparity, several movies' features were studied such as the nationality or the movie run time. 
          It appeared that no conclusion could be taken out from those observations because no conclusive trend appeared for the nationality
          (the actresses are always a minority in the movies) 
          and because of too big disparity in the results of the movie runtime.

        <h2 id="Part 2" style="text-align: center;">🎭 Genderedness of Tropes 🎭</h2>
        <p>As any other popular media, films reflect societal biases and perspectives through the use of tropes. These are narrative elements describing stereotypical characters and plot arcs that are common across movies. Tropes range from classics like 'dumb blonde' and 'the Casanova' to the 'Absent minded professor'. </p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/L4TTcR1mS8a5955TQY" width="360" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
        </div>
      
        <p>
          In our study, drawing inspiration from 
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00092" target="_blank">Ghala et al.'s methodology</a>, 
          we assessed the genderedness of 27,000 narrative tropes in movies by giving them a score 
          to classify them as male, female, or unisex.
        </p>
          
        <h4 id="Subpart2.0.1">Delving into the themes</h4>
        <p>
          Having assigned each trope to a class (male, female or unisex), we asked ourselves: what stories are these gendered tropes telling? To answer this, we conducted a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis on all our tropes to identify the most prevalent themes among them.
        </p>
        
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <img src="assets/img/woman.png" width="500px" height="500px" alt="Female trope analysis" style="margin-right: 0px;">
            <img src="assets/img/man.png" width="500px" height="500px" alt="Male trope analysis">
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Our results revealed an interesting set of patterns: 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <b>Female Themes:</b> Our analysis showed that tropes classified as female fall under one of two categories: "Apparance and Styling" or "Family" with significant emphasis on themes of relationships, motherhood, and physical attributes. In fact the most probable category female tropes fall under is that of "Family":
        
        </p>
        <iframe src="assets/plot/female_boxplot.html" width="750px" height="630px" frameborder="0" position="relative">Distribution of Topic Probabiliies Across Female Gendered Tropes</iframe>
        <p>
          This analysis presented us with an indication of bias as it suggested that perhaps female characters may be primarily represented through their relationships with others and in particular through family bonds. 
          The prevalence of the "Appearance and Styling" them also made us think whether such tropes could limit womens' representation in film.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Male Themes:</b> The topics identified to describe our male tropes were made up of a "General/Miscellaneous" category including non-specific, diverse terms and an "Action and Adventure" category containing words related to superhero and fantasy films as well as war and action. Although the general/miscellaneous theme may not seem highly coherent and interpretable, the number of topics was not changed as it resulted in stable and reproducible LDA results.
        </p>
        <iframe src="assets/plot/male_boxplot.html" width="750px" height="630px" frameborder="0" position="relative">Distribution of Topic Probabiliies Across Male Gendered Tropes</iframe>
        <p>
          The more general nature of the dominant topic in male tropes may suggest a wider diversity of roles attributed to male characters. At the same time, the action and adventure theme may indicate an association of male characters with action-packed, adventurous, and powerful roles.
          Although we identified trends that may reveal an aspect of gender bias in the film industry, we had to ask ourselves: are these results significant?
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Q7pytHHaVKGrSzhkpE" width="360" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
          In reality the vast majority of our tropes in the corpus have been classified as unisex by our model:
        </p>
        <iframe src="assets/plot/trop_dist.html" width="750px" height="630px" frameborder="0" position="relative">Distribution of Genderedness Scores in corpus</iframe>
        <p>
          In fact, looking at the proportions of tropes representing the top 10 most frequent genres across our movies we notice that unisex tropes make up more than 85% of tropes across all genres:
        
        </p>
        <iframe src="assets/plot/genre_tropes.html" width="750px" height="630px" frameborder="0" position="relative">Distribution of Tropes Across Top 10 Movie Genres</iframe>
        <p>
          Indeed our model was limited by its simplicity and the inherent uncertainty of our score discretisation to gender labels. Due to this, certain tropes may fall in a class that does not accurately represent them. More specifically, although we aimed to discretise our genderedness scores by maximising the overall f1 score in the classification process, the result produces a relatively low precision for unisex (0.41) and male tropes (0.63).

          At the same time, as we did not distinguish between tropes tropes that refer to entire movie plots and those that concern specific characters, drawing conclusions about gender becomes even more challenging.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hence, it is suggested that should this project be revisited, a more sophisticated approach to trope classification should be used. This could involve the use of a more reliable machine learning classification algorithm. Future work should focus on properly classifying the tropes are character specific or movie specific as well as identifying the characters they refer to and their sex. This would allow an analysis of a smaller and potentially more informative subset of tropes from which direct and more robust conclusions about gender bias in film could be drawn. A clustering algorithm could then be trained to more effectively associate character tropes to their 'gender'.
        </p>

        <h4>So are movie tropes free of gender bias?</h4>
        <p>
          Are we witnessing the end of gender bias in cinema? Not quite. Despite the prevalence of unisex tropes, the nuances of gender representation are still skewed. Our subsequent survival analysis on actors' careers further underscores this, revealing stark disparities in career longevity between male and female actors.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">🎞️ Career Longevity in Cinema: 🎞️</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"> A Survival Analysis Perspective </h3>
        <p>
          Let's take a step back and look at the big picture — how long do actors stay in the spotlight, and does it differ for men and women? Our investigation peeks behind the curtain to reveal the ebb and flow of acting careers through the lens of gender.
          Imagine a snapshot showing the length of actors' careers with two colors: one for men and one for women. What we see is that men generally have a slightly longer stay in the world of cinema. But it's not just about who stays longer; it's about the range of career lengths. Men's careers seem to have more variation — some have brief cameos while others enjoy enduring lead roles.
          
        </p>
      <iframe src="assets/plot/boxplot_mf.html" width="750px" height="650px" frameborder="0" position="relative">Proportion gender actor population plot</iframe>
        <p>
          Now, think of a line that climbs a hill. This line represents the chance of an actor continuing to work over the years. We drew two lines — one for men and one for women. These lines show us a clear difference: the chances of continuing an acting career indeed vary by gender. And this isn't just a guess; the numbers are strong enough to say it's a fact.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="assets/img/line.jpeg" width="562.5px" height="472.5px" frameborder="0" position="relative"></img>
        </div>
        <h4>Does Gender Steer the Story?</h4>
        <p>
          While numbers don't lie, they don't tell the whole story either. They don't say who will have the longest career or why. But they do suggest a pattern — one that we see when we look at who's still active in films and who's not.
          In our story, 'active' means having been in a movie in the last ten years. Those who have, take the stage as our 'non-censored' actors. They're the majority, showing that many actors' stories are still being written.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if we could play detective and guess an actor's gender just by looking at their career details? Given the patterns we've seen, it seems possible. Could the length of an actor's career, the roles they play, and their activity give us clues?
        </p>
        <p>
          We took on the challenge of guessing actor's genders based on parameters such as the number of movies they played in, their height or their most recurrent movie genre. Our quest yielded average results — a 66% accuracy across four different models. This is a starting point, but it suggests room for improvement. Perhaps there are confounders we haven't considered or aspects of the data that need refining. 
          One technical hurdle we faced was the abundance of categorical data, which required one-hot encoding to fit into our models. This process can dilute the potency of certain data types when it comes to classification tasks. It's possible that this impacted our models' ability to predict accurately.

        <h3 id="Subpart4.1">What do people vote?</h3>
        <p>Before diving deep into what influences the ratings, lets see first what people vote in general and how it changed across the years. 
          This can give us some perspective on all the exciting cases that follow. Clearly visualized on the graph that follows, is that most of the votes are between 5-7 rating, 
          showing that people tend to give a rating above average, or thinking differently, the average for a movie is a rating of 6.3.
          But was that always the case? Let’s see is the average rating for the movies made each year changes along the years. 
          We can distinguish two parts of the changes in rating. The first part show that in the start of the 20th century, up until around 1928, the average rating of the movies was increasing. 
          The Pearson and Spearman correlations that give a p-value lower than 0.05 reinforce this conclusion. 
          However, the high 95% Confidence intervals suggest that the data are not that reliable. Then after 1928, the ratings start to decline as the years go by with negative significant correlation, with the data being more reliable.</p>

        <p>Now that we saw an overview of the ratings, let’s see some other parameters.</p>
        
        <h3 id="Subpart4.2">What are the other parameters that affect the ratings?</h3>
        <p>Now that we saw an overview of the ratings, let’s see some other parameters. 
          First, we will see how the runtime of the movie affects the ratings. 
        </p>

        <h4 id="Subpart4.2.1">Runtime</h4>
        <p>Do people generally prefer movies that run for a long time or do they prefer short movies, or are they indifferent to the duration of the movie?  
        Well, you can always find the answer here! For the most reliable data, for movies from around 60 to 200 minutes of runtime there can be seen a slight 
        but statistically significant increase in the rating as the runtime goes up. 
        It seems either that people like longer movies or if a movie is longer it is most likely to be better! </p>
        <iframe src="assets/plot/line_rat_runtime.html" width="850px" height="530px" frameborder="0" position="relative">Runtime plot</iframe> 

        <h4 id="Subpart4.2.2">Average age of the cast</h4>
        <p> Let’s now look at something else, the average age of the cast. Do people give higher ratings to movies that employ and cast older people? Or a younger, 
        more vibrant and livelier cast is the way to go in order to get the people to give a good vote? With one quick look it seems that it does not actually matter.
        Both the Pearson and Spearman correlation statistics give a p-value around 0.5 which can help us reject the null hypothesis that the average age of the cast of the movie and the rating it gets are correlated.</p>
        <iframe src="assets/plot/dist_rat_age.html" width="750px" height="530px" frameborder="0" position="relative">Age plot</iframe> 

        <h4 id="Subpart4.2.3">Genres, Languages and Country</h4>
        <p>Let’s continue to some distributions. Below we can see the distributions of the ratings for each genre and for languages and countries of the movies 
        (we show countries and languages that more than 50 movies were made in each country and language). If there is a lot of variation between the distributions of the different categories for all these three variables, 
        we can assume naively that there is some influence of the variable to the average rating. We can see that there is some variation of the average of the ratings, between 6 to 8, for the genres, 6 to 7.5 for languages and 6 to 6.7 for the countries. 
        Therefore, we naively say that the genre and the language of the movie can influence the rating of the movie. </p>

        <h2 id="Subpart4.3" style="text-align: center;">✨ The influence of the gender ✨</h2>
            
        <p>Finally, it is time to address the elephant in the room, does gender play a role in the ratings that people give to the movies. 
          As mentioned above, we are using the fraction of female actors in the movie. The naïve analysis shows that that there is a small but significant negative correlation between 
          the female fraction of actors in the movie and the average rating. We can also see again that the female fraction of actors is generally below 0.35. 
          This could be for a lot of reasons, for example people might like genres or that are best suited for male actors, or these genres are more carefully made. </p>
        <iframe src="assets/plot/line_rat_frac_female.html" width="850px" height="530px" frameborder="0" position="relative">Frac female</iframe>

        <h4 id="Subpart4.1"> Is this really the case?</h4>
        <p>Until now, we were looking at these cases naively and saw that many confounders can affect the average rating of a movie. To make sure that the fraction of female actors affects the average rating, we need to isolate its effect, 
          that is we are going to perform a causal analysis. To do that we use a treatment and a control group. The treatment group is defined as the movies that have more female than male actors in their cast, whereas the control group is the opposite. 
          So, we used propensity score matching for the above confounders that showed some correlation with the average rating. 
          After matching we can see that the distribution of the average rating between the two groups is very similar, with the treatment group (more females than males in a movie) 
          having a bit more probability to have around 4.5-7 and the control group a bit more probability above 7. The correlation statistics show a in the end that the fraction of female actors in a movie have little to no correlation to the average rating.
